## Overview

This is my third try of FrontEndMentor challenges. For this challenge I have decided to use tailwind as a CSS framework. It was super easy to develop this notification page using Tailwind CSS. I faced some issued deploying project to Netlify and search all over the internet and found the bug and fixed it. It took me almost 1 day to find the solution :D

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
